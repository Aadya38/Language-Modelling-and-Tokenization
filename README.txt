The NLP Toolkit is a Python library designed to assist in natural language processing tasks. It provides functionalities for tokenization, n-gram modeling, smoothing techniques, and more. Whether you're analyzing text data, building language models, or conducting sentiment analysis, the NLP Toolkit can help streamline your workflow.


Usage
Tokenization
Tokenization is the process of splitting text into individual words or tokens. The NLP Toolkit provides a tokenization module that supports various tokenization methods, including word-based tokenization, sentence-based tokenization, and regex-based tokenization.


N-gram Modeling
N-gram modeling is a statistical language modeling technique used to predict the probability of a word given its context. The NLP Toolkit supports n-gram modeling with customizable n-gram orders and provides functionalities for generating n-gram models from text data.


Smoothing Techniques
Smoothing techniques are used to adjust the probabilities of n-grams to handle unseen data and improve the robustness of language models. The NLP Toolkit supports various smoothing techniques, including Laplace smoothing and Good-Turing smoothing.


Linear Interpolation
Linear interpolation is a language modeling technique that combines the probabilities of different n-grams using weighted averages. It estimates the optimal weights, known as lambdas, based on the observed frequencies of n-grams in the training data.
