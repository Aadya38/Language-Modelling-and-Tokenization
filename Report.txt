Report: Language Modeling and N-Gram Smoothing

Introduction:
The provided code implements various techniques for language modeling and n-gram smoothing, crucial tasks in natural language processing. These techniques aim to enhance the accuracy and robustness of language models by addressing issues such as data sparsity and overfitting.

Key Components:

Tokenizer: The Tokenizer class preprocesses the text data by tokenizing sentences, handling special characters, and generating tagged and tokenized outputs for further analysis.
N-Gram Model Generation: The generate_ngram_model function constructs an n-gram model from the tokenized text data. It generates n-grams of a specified order N and stores their counts in a defaultdict data structure for efficient storage and retrieval.
Smoothing Techniques: The code provides implementations of Good-Turing smoothing and Linear Interpolation. These techniques mitigate the issues of zero counts and data sparsity in n-gram models by adjusting probability estimates based on observed frequencies and optimal weight estimation, respectively.

For Linear Interpolation, for generating output file I ran with some issues without any error message, that is why couldnt debug since code was running smoothly.


Output Handling: Output files are generated to store the n-gram models, smoothed probabilities, and lambda values obtained through interpolation.
Usage and Results:
We can apply the provided code to train language models, perform smoothing. By utilizing different smoothing techniques and n-gram orders, researchers and practitioners can develop language models tailored to specific tasks and datasets, improving the accuracy and effectiveness of natural language processing applications.

Conclusion:
The code offers a comprehensive framework for language modeling and n-gram smoothing, essential tasks in natural language processing. By implementing these techniques, users can develop robust language models capable of accurately predicting word sequences and capturing the underlying structure of natural language data.
